- **Flexible Applicability**: Discounts can apply to training fees, store purchases, or both
- **Usage Controls**: One-time or ongoing discounts with customizable usage limits
- **Family & Student Scope**: Discounts can be applied per student or per family
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all discount usage and assignments
- **Template System**: Reusable discount templates for consistent automatic assignment

## User Interface

### Admin Navigation Structure

The discount system is organized under `/admin` with three main sections:

```typescript
const discountMenuItems = [
    {href: "/admin/discount-codes", label: "Discount Codes", description: "Manage manual discount codes"},
    {href: "/admin/discount-templates", label: "Discount Templates", description: "Create reusable discount templates"},
    {href: "/admin/automatic-discounts", label: "Automatic Discounts", description: "Configure automation rules"}
];
```

### Admin Interfaces

#### Manual Discount Management

- **List View** (`/admin/discount-codes`): Comprehensive table with filtering, search, and bulk operations
- **Create Form** (`/admin/discount-codes/new`): Full form with validation for all discount parameters
- **Edit Interface**: In-place editing with real-time validation

#### Automatic Discount Management

- **Rules List** (`/admin/automatic-discounts`): Overview of automation rules with statistics
- **Rule Creation** (`/admin/automatic-discounts/new`): Advanced form for creating automation rules
- **Rule Editing** (`/admin/automatic-discounts/:id`): Comprehensive editing interface
- **Assignments Tracking** (`/admin/automatic-discounts/assignments`): Real-time monitoring of discount assignments
- **Utilities** (`/admin/automatic-discounts/utilities`): Batch processing and testing tools

### User-Facing Components

#### DiscountCodeSelector Component

Located in `app/components/DiscountCodeSelector.tsx`:

- Real-time discount code validation
- Visual feedback for applied discounts
- Integration with payment flow
- Error handling and user guidance

## API Endpoints

### Manual Discount APIs

- `POST /api/discount-codes/validate` - Validate discount code and calculate discount amount
- `GET /api/available-discounts/:familyId` - Get available discounts for a family
- `GET /admin/api/discount-codes` - List all discount codes for admin
- `POST /admin/api/discount-codes` - Create new discount code
- `PUT /admin/api/discount-codes/:id` - Update existing discount code
- `DELETE /admin/api/discount-codes/:id` - Deactivate discount code

### Automatic Discount APIs

- `POST /api/discount-events` - Record new discount event
- `GET /admin/api/automation-rules` - List automation rules
- `POST /admin/api/automation-rules` - Create automation rule
- `PUT /admin/api/automation-rules/:id` - Update automation rule
- `DELETE /admin/api/automation-rules/:id` - Delete automation rule
- `GET /admin/api/discount-assignments` - List discount assignments with filtering
- `POST /admin/api/process-events` - Batch process events

## Event Processing Flow

### Automatic Discount Assignment Process

1. **Event Creation**: When a qualifying action occurs, create an event record using `recordEvent()`
2. **Rule Matching**: Find active automation rules that match the event type
3. **Condition Evaluation**: Check additional conditions (age, belt level, program enrollment, etc.)
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Verify student hasn't already received this type of discount
5. **Code Generation**: Create discount code from the linked template
6. **Assignment**: Link the discount code to the student/family
7. **Tracking**: Record the assignment for audit and reporting

### Supported Event Types

- **student_enrollment**: Triggered when a new student enrolls
- **first_payment**: Activated on a family's first payment
- **belt_promotion**: Fired when a student achieves a new belt rank
- **attendance_milestone**: Triggered after reaching attendance goals (e.g., every 5 classes)
- **family_referral**: Activated when a family refers another family
- **birthday**: Triggered on student birthdays
- **seasonal_promotion**: For special campaigns and promotions

### Example Automation Rules

#### New Student Welcome Discount

```json
{
  "name": "New Student Welcome - Kids",
  "event_type": "student_enrollment",
  "conditions": {
    "student_age_max": 12
  },
  "applicable_programs": [
    "kids-karate-uuid"
  ],
  "max_uses_per_student": 1,
  "discount_template": {
    "discount_type": "percentage",
    "discount_value": 50,
    "applicable_to": "training",
    "validity_days": 30
  }
}
```

#### Belt Promotion Rewards

```json
{
  "name": "Belt Promotion Store Credit",
  "event_type": "belt_promotion",
  "conditions": {
    "belt_level_min": "yellow"
  },
  "max_uses_per_student": 3,
  "discount_template": {
    "discount_type": "fixed_amount",
    "discount_value": 25,
    "applicable_to": "store",
    "validity_days": 60
  }
}
```

## Technical Considerations

### Discount Calculation Logic

- **Fixed Amount**: Subtract exact dollar amount from subtotal
- **Percentage**: Calculate percentage of subtotal (before tax)
- **Minimum Amount**: Ensure final amount never goes below $0
- **Tax Application**: Apply discount before tax calculation
- **Multiple Discounts**: System supports stacking rules (configurable)

### Security & Validation

- **Server-Side Validation**: All discount codes validated on server before application
- **Usage Limits**: Strict enforcement of one-time and maximum usage limits
- **Expiry Checks**: Automatic validation of validity dates
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all discount usage and assignments
- **Access Control**: RLS policies ensure proper data isolation
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs properly validated and sanitized

### Performance Optimizations

- **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Caching**: Active discount codes cached for fast lookups
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized SQL queries for usage validation
- **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple events simultaneously
- **Lazy Loading**: Admin interfaces use pagination for large datasets

### Code Quality & Type Safety

- **TypeScript Coverage**: 100% TypeScript with zero `any` types
- **ESLint Compliance**: All code passes ESLint validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the system
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Testing Ready**: Architecture supports unit and integration testing

## Integration Points

### Event Recording Integration

The system provides utilities for integrating discount events into existing business logic:

```typescript
// Student enrollment
await recordDiscountEvent('student_enrollment', {
    student_id: newStudent.id,
    family_id: newStudent.family_id,
    event_data: {
        enrollment_date: new Date(),
        program_ids: enrolledPrograms.map(p => p.id)
    }
});

// Payment processing
await recordDiscountEvent('first_payment', {
    family_id: payment.family_id,
    event_data: {
        payment_amount: payment.amount,
        payment_date: payment.created_at
    }
});
```

### Payment Flow Integration

The discount system seamlessly integrates with the existing payment processing:

1. User selects items for purchase
2. DiscountCodeSelector component allows code entry
3. Real-time validation provides immediate feedback
4. Discount applied to payment calculation
5. Payment processed with discount details recorded
6. Usage tracking updated automatically

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Assignment Statistics

- **Total Assignments**: Count of all automatic discount assignments
- **Usage Rates**: Percentage of assigned discounts actually used
- **Popular Rules**: Most frequently triggered automation rules
- **Event Distribution**: Breakdown of assignments by event type
- **Revenue Impact**: Total discount amounts granted and used

### Performance Metrics

- **Processing Time**: Average time to process events and assign discounts
- **Success Rates**: Percentage of events successfully processed
- **Error Tracking**: Failed assignments and their reasons
- **Rule Effectiveness**: Which rules generate the most valuable assignments

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Email Notifications**: Automatically notify families about newly assigned discounts
- **Advanced Conditions**: Support for complex rule conditions (multiple events, time-based triggers)
- **A/B Testing**: Test different discount strategies for optimization
- **Advanced Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard for discount performance analysis
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass assignment or modification of rules
- **External Integrations**: Trigger events from third-party platforms
