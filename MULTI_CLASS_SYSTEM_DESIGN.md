# Multi-Class System Design & Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for a comprehensive multi-class system that supports **Programs** (templates) and **Classes** (instances) with enrollment management, scheduling, and integrated messaging.

## Core Concepts

### Programs
Programs are reusable templates that define:
- **Name & Description**: Clear identification and purpose
- **Pricing Structure**: Flexible pricing rules and payment options
- **Eligibility Rules**: Age ranges, skill levels, accessibility requirements
- **Class Parameters**: Duration, frequency, capacity limits
- **Examples**: 
  - "Little Dragons (Ages 4-6)" - 30min classes, 2x/week
  - "Adult Competition Prep" - 90min classes, 3x/week
  - "Adaptive Karate" - Modified classes for students with disabilities

### Classes
Classes are specific scheduled instances of programs:
- **Program Instance**: Based on a program template
- **Schedule**: Specific days, times, and duration
- **Enrollment**: Student registration and capacity management
- **Calendar Integration**: Session scheduling and attendance tracking
- **Instructor Assignment**: Staff management per class

## Database Schema Design

### New Tables

#### Programs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE programs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NULL,
  duration_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 60,
  monthly_fee NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
  yearly_fee NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
  individual_session_fee NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
  registration_fee NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
  min_age INTEGER CHECK (min_age >= 0),
  max_age INTEGER CHECK (max_age >= min_age),
  gender_restriction TEXT DEFAULT 'none' CHECK (gender_restriction IN ('male', 'female', 'none')),
  special_needs_support BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Simplified pricing structure with explicit columns:
-- - monthly_fee: Monthly subscription fee
-- - yearly_fee: Annual subscription fee (discounted)
-- - individual_session_fee: Drop-in/single session fee
-- - registration_fee: One-time registration fee
--
-- Simplified eligibility with explicit columns:
-- - min_age/max_age: Age restrictions
-- - gender_restriction: Gender limitations if any
-- - special_needs_support: Whether program supports special needs students
```

#### Classes Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE classes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  program_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES programs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NULL,
  max_capacity INTEGER NULL,
  instructor_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Classes table includes:
-- - instructor_id for direct instructor assignment
-- - Removed schedule JSONB (use normalized class_schedules table)
-- - Removed current_enrollment (calculate dynamically from enrollments table)
-- - Schedule information moved to separate class_schedules table for normalization
```

#### Enrollments Table
```sql
CREATE TYPE enrollment_status AS ENUM ('pending', 'active', 'completed', 'dropped', 'cancelled', 'waitlist');

CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  program_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES programs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  class_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES classes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  student_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  enrollment_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  status enrollment_status DEFAULT 'pending',
  payment_id UUID REFERENCES payments(id),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(class_id, student_id)
);
```

#### Class Sessions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE class_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  class_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES classes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  session_date DATE NOT NULL,
  start_time TIME NOT NULL,
  end_time TIME NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'scheduled' CHECK (status IN ('scheduled', 'completed', 'cancelled')),
  instructor_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Modified Tables

#### Update Attendance Table
```sql
-- Add class_session_id to link attendance to specific class sessions
ALTER TABLE attendance ADD COLUMN class_session_id UUID REFERENCES class_sessions(id);
ALTER TABLE attendance ADD COLUMN class_id UUID REFERENCES classes(id);
```

#### Update Conversations Table
```sql
-- Add class-based messaging support
ALTER TABLE conversations ADD COLUMN class_id UUID REFERENCES classes(id);
ALTER TABLE conversations ADD COLUMN message_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'individual' 
  CHECK (message_type IN ('individual', 'class_announcement', 'general'));
```

#### Update Payment Types
```sql
-- Add new payment type for class enrollments
ALTER TYPE payment_type_enum ADD VALUE 'class_enrollment';
```

### Key Implementation Notes

#### Enrollment Status Management
- Uses `enrollment_status` enum for type safety
- Supports workflow: pending → active → completed/dropped/cancelled/waitlist
- Includes `program_id` for direct program association
- Automatic enrollment count updates via database triggers

#### Instructor Assignment
- Direct assignment via `instructor_id` in classes table
- References `profiles(id)` for instructor profiles
- Supports flexible instructor scheduling per class

#### Database Triggers and Functions
- `generate_class_sessions()` - Creates class sessions based on schedules and program duration
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp triggers for all tables
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control

**Note**: The `update_class_enrollment_count()` function and `current_enrollment` column have been removed. Enrollment counts are now calculated dynamically for better data consistency.

### Database Architecture: Hybrid JSONB + Explicit Columns

**Migration 002: Explicit Columns Enhancement**

The system uses a hybrid approach combining explicit columns for commonly used fields with JSONB for additional/custom data:

**Benefits:**
- **Performance**: Explicit columns enable efficient indexing and faster queries
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for frequently accessed fields
- **Flexibility**: JSONB fields remain for custom/additional data
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing JSONB data is preserved

**Implementation Details:**
- Explicit columns are used when available
- JSONB fields serve as fallback for additional data
- Updated `generate_class_sessions()` function intelligently uses explicit columns first
- Comprehensive indexing strategy for optimal query performance

**Indexes Created:**
```sql
-- Performance indexes for explicit columns
CREATE INDEX idx_programs_monthly_fee ON programs(monthly_fee);
CREATE INDEX idx_programs_age_range ON programs(min_age, max_age);
CREATE INDEX idx_programs_gender_restriction ON programs(gender_restriction);
CREATE INDEX idx_programs_special_needs ON programs(special_needs_support);
CREATE INDEX idx_classes_program_id ON classes(program_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_classes_instructor_id ON classes(instructor_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_enrollments_class_id ON enrollments(class_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_enrollments_student_id ON enrollments(student_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_enrollments_status ON enrollments(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_class_sessions_class_id ON class_sessions(class_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_class_sessions_date ON class_sessions(session_date);
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

Implement RLS policies to ensure data security:

```sql
-- Programs: Authenticated users can view active programs, admins manage all
ALTER TABLE programs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Programs are viewable by authenticated users" ON programs
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND is_active = true);
CREATE POLICY "Programs are manageable by admins" ON programs
  FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');

-- Classes: Authenticated users can view active classes, admins manage all
ALTER TABLE classes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Classes are viewable by authenticated users" ON classes
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND is_active = true);
CREATE POLICY "Classes are manageable by admins" ON classes
  FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');

-- Enrollments: Families can view their own enrollments, admins manage all
ALTER TABLE enrollments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Enrollments are viewable by family members" ON enrollments
  FOR SELECT USING (
    student_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM students WHERE family_id = auth.jwt() ->> 'family_id'
    )
  );
CREATE POLICY "Enrollments are manageable by admins" ON enrollments
  FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');

-- Class Sessions: Authenticated users can view, admins manage
ALTER TABLE class_sessions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Class sessions are viewable by authenticated users" ON class_sessions
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
CREATE POLICY "Class sessions are manageable by admins" ON class_sessions
  FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');
```

## Admin Console Implementation

### Navigation Updates

The admin navigation has been enhanced to include multi-class system management:

```typescript
// Updated admin navigation structure
const adminNavigation = [
  { name: 'Dashboard', href: '/admin', icon: HomeIcon },
  { name: 'Families', href: '/admin/families', icon: UsersIcon },
  { name: 'Students', href: '/admin/students', icon: AcademicCapIcon },
  { name: 'Programs', href: '/admin/programs', icon: BookOpenIcon }, // New
  { name: 'Classes', href: '/admin/classes', icon: CalendarIcon }, // New
  { name: 'Enrollments', href: '/admin/enrollments', icon: UserPlusIcon }, // New
  { name: 'Attendance', href: '/admin/attendance', icon: ClipboardCheckIcon },
  { name: 'Payments', href: '/admin/payments', icon: CreditCardIcon },
  { name: 'Messages', href: '/admin/messages', icon: ChatBubbleLeftIcon },
  { name: 'Store', href: '/admin/store', icon: ShoppingBagIcon },
];
```

### Dashboard Implementation

The admin dashboard (`admin._index.tsx`) has been enhanced with comprehensive multi-class system statistics:

#### Statistics Cards
- **Active Programs**: Shows count of currently active training programs with link to program management
- **Active Classes**: Displays number of active classes across all programs with link to class management
- **Total Enrollments**: Shows total student enrollments in all classes with link to enrollment management
- **Capacity Utilization**: Displays overall capacity usage across all active classes
- **Quick Actions**: Direct access buttons for creating new programs and classes
- **Visual Consistency**: Unified green color scheme for improved user experience

#### Data Integration
- Real-time statistics fetched from program, class, and enrollment services
- Efficient data aggregation using Supabase queries
- Performance-optimized loading with proper error handling
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop access

### New Admin Routes

### Service Layer

Create new service files:

#### `app/services/program.server.ts`
```typescript
export interface Program {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  pricingStructure: PricingStructure;

  prerequisites?: string[];
}

export async function createProgram(program: Omit<Program, 'id'>): Promise<Program>
export async function updateProgram(id: string, updates: Partial<Program>): Promise<Program>
export async function deleteProgram(id: string): Promise<void>
export async function getPrograms(): Promise<Program[]>
export async function getProgramById(id: string): Promise<Program | null>
```

#### `app/services/class.server.ts`
```typescript

export async function getEnrollmentsByStudent(studentId: string): Promise<Enrollment[]>
export async function getEnrollmentsByFamily(familyId: string): Promise<Enrollment[]>
```

## Family Portal Implementation

### New Family Routes

#### Class Browsing & Enrollment
- [ ] `_layout.family.classes._index.tsx` - Browse available programs (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- [ ] `_layout.family.classes.program.$programId.tsx` - Program details with available classes (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- [ ] `_layout.family.classes.enroll.$classId.tsx` - Enrollment form (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- [ ] `_layout.family.classes.schedule.tsx` - Family class calendar (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- [ ] `_layout.family.student.$studentId.classes.tsx` - Student's enrolled classes (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Current Implementation:** Families currently use:
- `_layout.classes.tsx` - General class schedule information
- `_layout.family.attendance.tsx` - View family attendance records
- `_layout.family._index.tsx` - Family portal dashboard with student management
- Admin enrollment interface at `admin.enrollments.new.tsx` for enrollment management

### Family Navigation Updates

Update `app/components/FamilyNavbar.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add to navigation items
const familyNavItems = [
  // ... existing items
  {to: "/family/classes", label: "Classes", icon: Calendar},
  {to: "/family/classes/schedule", label: "Schedule", icon: CalendarDays},
  // ... rest of items
];
```

### Calendar Integration

**TO BE IMPLEMENTED:** Create `app/components/ClassCalendar.tsx`:

```typescript
export interface ClassCalendarProps {
  enrollments: Enrollment[];
  viewMode: 'week' | 'month';
  selectedDate?: Date;
}

export function ClassCalendar({ enrollments, viewMode, selectedDate }: ClassCalendarProps) {
  // Calendar component showing upcoming classes
  // Integration with class sessions
  // Color coding by program/class
  // Click to view class details
}
```

**Backend Ready:** Calendar functionality exists in `app/services/class.server.ts` with `getCalendarEvents()` and `getWeeklySchedule()` functions, and calendar types are defined in `app/types/multi-class.ts`.

## Messaging System Extensions

### Class-Based Messaging

Extend existing messaging system:

#### Database Updates
```sql
-- New table for class message recipients
CREATE TABLE class_message_recipients (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  conversation_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  family_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES families(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  class_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES classes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Admin Messaging Interface

Update `admin.messages.new.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add class selection option
export interface MessageRecipientOptions {
  type: 'individual' | 'class' | 'all_families';
  classId?: string;
  familyId?: string;
}

// Bulk messaging for class announcements
export async function sendClassAnnouncement(
  classId: string,
  subject: string,
  content: string,
  senderId: string
): Promise<void>
```

## Payment Integration

### Program-Based Pricing

Extend payment system to support:
- Program enrollment fees
- Monthly/weekly class payments
- Family discounts for multiple enrollments
- Prorated payments for mid-session enrollments

### Payment Types

Update payment processing:

```typescript
// Add to payment creation
export interface ClassPaymentData {
  programId: string;
  classId: string;
  studentId: string;
  enrollmentType: 'full_session' | 'monthly' | 'drop_in';
  discountCodes?: string[];
}

export async function createClassPayment(paymentData: ClassPaymentData): Promise<Payment>
```

**Status Notes:** The family calendar interface is fully implemented with comprehensive features including monthly navigation, student filtering, event details, and mobile responsiveness. The calendar displays both scheduled class sessions and attendance records with detailed event information.

## Current Family Enrollment Process

**IMPORTANT: Families cannot currently self-enroll students in classes.** The enrollment process requires administrator intervention.

### How Families Currently Enroll Students:

1. **Contact Administration**: Families must contact the school directly (phone, email, or in-person)
2. **Admin Processing**: Staff use the admin enrollment interface (`admin.enrollments.new.tsx`) to:
   - Select the family from a dropdown list
   - Choose the student to enroll from that family
   - Select the desired class from available options
   - Process enrollment with automatic validation (capacity, conflicts, eligibility)
3. **Payment Processing**: Families can complete payments through the family portal (`_layout.family.payment.tsx`)

### What Families Can Currently Do:

- **View Classes**: Browse general class information via `_layout.classes.tsx`
- **Manage Students**: Add new students to their family via `_layout.family.add-student.tsx`
- **Track Attendance**: View attendance records via `_layout.family.attendance.tsx`
- **View Enrollments**: See current enrollments on the family dashboard (`_layout.family._index.tsx`)
- **Process Payments**: Complete enrollment payments and view payment history

### Missing Family Self-Service Features:

**The following routes are designed but NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:**
- `_layout.family.classes._index.tsx` - Browse available programs and classes
- `_layout.family.classes.program.$programId.tsx` - View detailed program information
- `_layout.family.classes.enroll.$classId.tsx` - Self-service enrollment interface

**Implemented Family Features:**
- ✅ `_layout.family.calendar.tsx` - Family-specific class calendar (COMPLETED)
- ✅ `_layout.family.attendance.tsx` - Attendance tracking and history
- ✅ `_layout.family._index.tsx` - Family dashboard with enrollment overview

**Backend Infrastructure Ready:** All enrollment services, validation logic, and payment processing are implemented and ready to support family self-enrollment when the frontend routes are built.

**Status Notes:** All calendar functionality is now complete. Family calendar interface (`_layout.family.calendar.tsx`), per-class admin session management (`admin.classes.$id.sessions.tsx`), and comprehensive admin calendar (`admin.calendar.tsx`) are fully implemented. Extracted reusable calendar components (`~/components/calendar/`) provide consistent calendar functionality across the application. The admin calendar includes enhanced filtering by program/instructor/status, enrollment statistics, administrative actions, and system-wide visibility of all classes and sessions.

### Phase 7: Messaging Integration (Week 8) ❌ NOT COMPLETED
- [ ] Class-based messaging system

## Admin Calendar System Design

### Overview
The Admin Calendar provides a comprehensive system-wide view of all classes, sessions, and events across programs. Building on the existing reusable calendar components and multi-class infrastructure, it offers enhanced administrative capabilities for managing the entire studio schedule.

### Core Architecture

#### Route Structure
```
/admin/calendar - Main admin calendar interface
```

#### Data Architecture
Extends the existing `CalendarEvent` interface with admin-specific properties:

```typescript
interface AdminCalendarEvent extends CalendarEvent {
  // Program and Class Context
  programId: string;
  programName: string;
  programColor?: string;
  classId: string;
  className: string;
  
  // Enrollment Information
  enrollmentStats: {
    enrolled: number;
    capacity: number;
    waitlist: number;
  };
  
  // Instructor Details
  instructorId?: string;
  instructorName?: string;
  
  // Administrative Metadata
  paymentStatus: 'pending' | 'partial' | 'complete';
  attendanceRecorded: boolean;
  sessionGenerated: boolean;
  
  // Quick Actions
  adminActions: {

#### Data Flow
```typescript
// Admin Calendar Loader
export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const month = url.searchParams.get('month') || getCurrentMonth();
  const programFilter = url.searchParams.get('program');
  const instructorFilter = url.searchParams.get('instructor');
  
  const events = await getAdminCalendarEvents({
    month,
    programFilter,
    instructorFilter,
    includeEnrollmentStats: true,
    includePaymentStatus: true,
    includeAdminActions: true
  });
  
  return json({ events, filters: { program: programFilter, instructor: instructorFilter } });
}
```
