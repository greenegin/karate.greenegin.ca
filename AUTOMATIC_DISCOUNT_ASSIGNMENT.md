# Automatic Discount Assignment Feature

## Overview

This document describes the design for an automatic discount assignment system that allows students to receive predefined discounts upon specific events (like enrollment). The system uses event-driven architecture with database-stored events and automation rules.

## Key Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Events are stored as database rows with predefined types
- **Flexible Automation Rules**: Link events to discount templates with configurable conditions
- **Automatic Assignment**: Discounts are automatically assigned when events occur
- **Admin Management**: New UI for managing automatic discount rules

## Database Schema

### Event Types Enum
```sql
CREATE TYPE discount_event_type AS ENUM (
  'student_enrollment',
  'first_payment',
  'belt_promotion',
  'attendance_milestone',
  'family_referral',
  'birthday',
  'seasonal_promotion'
);
```

### Events Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE discount_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  event_type discount_event_type NOT NULL,
  student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id),
  family_id UUID REFERENCES families(id),
  event_data JSONB, -- Additional event-specific data
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  
  INDEX idx_discount_events_type (event_type),
  INDEX idx_discount_events_student (student_id),
  INDEX idx_discount_events_family (family_id),
  INDEX idx_discount_events_processed (processed_at)
);
```

### Automation Rules Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE discount_automation_rules (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  event_type discount_event_type NOT NULL,
  discount_template_id UUID REFERENCES discount_templates(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  conditions JSONB, -- Additional conditions (e.g., student age, belt level)
  applicable_programs uuid[], -- Program filtering: restrict rule to specific programs
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  max_uses_per_student INTEGER, -- Limit how many times a student can benefit
  valid_from TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  valid_until TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  INDEX idx_automation_rules_event_type (event_type),
  INDEX idx_automation_rules_active (is_active),
  INDEX idx_automation_rules_template (discount_template_id),
  INDEX idx_automation_rules_programs USING GIN (applicable_programs)
);
```

### Discount Assignments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE discount_assignments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  automation_rule_id UUID REFERENCES discount_automation_rules(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  discount_event_id UUID REFERENCES discount_events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id),
  family_id UUID REFERENCES families(id),
  discount_code_id UUID REFERENCES discount_codes(id),
  assigned_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  
  INDEX idx_discount_assignments_student (student_id),
  INDEX idx_discount_assignments_family (family_id),
  INDEX idx_discount_assignments_rule (automation_rule_id),
  INDEX idx_discount_assignments_event (discount_event_id)
);
```

## Service Architecture

### AutoDiscountService

A new service class that handles:
- Processing events and matching them to automation rules
- Creating discount codes from templates
- Assigning discounts to students/families
- Tracking usage and preventing duplicate assignments

```typescript
class AutoDiscountService {
  static async processEvent(eventId: string): Promise<void>
  static async createAutomationRule(rule: CreateAutomationRuleRequest): Promise<AutomationRule>
  static async getAutomationRules(): Promise<AutomationRule[]>
  static async updateAutomationRule(id: string, updates: UpdateAutomationRuleRequest): Promise<AutomationRule>
  static async deleteAutomationRule(id: string): Promise<void>
  static async getAssignments(filters?: AssignmentFilters): Promise<DiscountAssignment[]>
}
```

## UI Components

### Admin Navigation

Add "Automatic Discounts" as the third item in the Discount admin menu:

```typescript
// In AdminNavbar.tsx
const discountItems = [
  { href: "/admin/discount-codes", label: "Discount Codes" },
  { href: "/admin/discount-templates", label: "Discount Templates" },
  { href: "/admin/automatic-discounts", label: "Automatic Discounts" }, // NEW
];
```

### New Admin Routes

- `/admin/automatic-discounts` - List automation rules
- `/admin/automatic-discounts/new` - Create new automation rule
- `/admin/automatic-discounts/:id/edit` - Edit automation rule
- `/admin/automatic-discounts/assignments` - View discount assignments
- `/admin/automatic-discounts/events` - View recent events

## Event Processing Flow

1. **Event Creation**: When a qualifying action occurs (e.g., student enrollment), create an event record
2. **Rule Matching**: Find active automation rules that match the event type
3. **Condition Checking**: Verify any additional conditions (age, belt level, etc.)
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Check if student already received this type of discount
5. **Code Generation**: Create discount code from the linked template
6. **Assignment**: Link the discount code to the student/family
7. **Notification**: Optionally notify the family about the new discount

## Program Filtering

Automation rules can now be restricted to specific programs using the `applicable_programs` field. This allows for targeted discount assignment based on which programs a student is enrolled in.

### How Program Filtering Works

1. **Rule Configuration**: When creating or editing an automation rule, administrators can select specific programs that the rule applies to
2. **Event Processing**: When an event is processed, the system checks if the student is enrolled in any of the rule's applicable programs
3. **Eligibility Check**: If `applicable_programs` is specified and the student has no matching program enrollments, the rule is skipped
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Rules without program restrictions continue to apply to all students regardless of their program enrollments

### Database Implementation

- **Field**: `applicable_programs uuid[]` - Array of program UUIDs
- **Index**: GIN index for efficient program filtering queries
- **Validation**: Database trigger ensures all program IDs are valid and active

### Service Integration

The `AutoDiscountService.evaluateRuleConditions()` method includes program filtering logic:

```typescript
// Check program filtering first
if (rule.applicable_programs && rule.applicable_programs.length > 0 && event.student_id) {
  const studentPrograms = await this.getStudentPrograms(event.student_id);
  const hasMatchingProgram = rule.applicable_programs.some(programId => 
    studentPrograms.includes(programId)
  );
  if (!hasMatchingProgram) {
    return false; // Student not enrolled in any applicable programs
  }
}
```

## Example Use Cases

### Student Enrollment Discounts
```json
{
  "name": "New Student Welcome Discounts",
  "event_type": "student_enrollment",
  "discount_template_id": "template-uuid",
  "conditions": {
    "student_age_max": 12
  },
  "max_uses_per_student": 2
}
```

### Program-Specific Belt Promotion Rewards
```json
{
  "name": "Competition Team Belt Promotion",
  "event_type": "belt_promotion",
  "discount_template_id": "template-uuid",
  "applicable_programs": ["competition-team-uuid", "advanced-training-uuid"],
  "conditions": {
    "belt_level_min": "yellow"
  },
  "max_uses_per_student": 1
}
```

### Age-Group Specific Enrollment Discounts
```json
{
  "name": "Little Dragons Welcome Discount",
  "event_type": "student_enrollment",
  "discount_template_id": "template-uuid",
  "applicable_programs": ["little-dragons-uuid"],
  "conditions": {
    "student_age_max": 6
  },
  "max_uses_per_student": 1
}
```

## Benefits

- **Automated Process**: Reduces manual work for administrators
- **Consistent Application**: Ensures all eligible students receive discounts
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy to create new rules for different scenarios
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of when and why discounts were assigned
- **Scalable**: Can handle multiple events and rules simultaneously
- **Type Safety**: Enum-based event types prevent errors and improve maintainability
