## Project Status

### Implemented Core Features
âœ… **Completed Phase 1 & 2**

  - Semantic HTML structure in layouts (nav, main, footer).

### Next Priority Features
*All major planned features implemented.*

### Potential Future Enhancements / Areas for Review
- **Content Quality:** Ensure public-facing page content is informative, engaging, and naturally incorporates relevant keywords.
- **Image Alt Text:** Conduct a site-wide review to ensure all meaningful images have descriptive `alt` attributes for SEO and accessibility.
- **Performance (Core Web Vitals):** Analyze and optimize page load speed and responsiveness using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights.
- **Accessibility (A11y):** Perform comprehensive accessibility checks (keyboard navigation, color contrast, ARIA attributes).

### Implemented Notifications
- **Student Absence:** Email sent to family when student marked absent (`/admin/attendance/record`).
- **Newly Required Waiver:** Email sent to families needing to sign when a waiver is marked as required (`/admin/waivers/:waiverId`).
- **Payment Reminder (Scheduled):** Supabase Edge Function (`payment-reminder`) runs periodically (via Cron Job) to email families with students whose eligibility status is 'Expired'. Requires deployment (`npx supabase functions deploy payment-reminder --no-verify-jwt`) and Cron Job setup in Supabase dashboard.
- **Missing Waiver Reminder (Scheduled):** Supabase Edge Function (`missing-waiver-reminder`) runs periodically (via Cron Job) to email families who are missing required waiver signatures. Requires deployment (`npx supabase functions deploy missing-waiver-reminder --no-verify-jwt`) and Cron Job setup.
- **Type Generation:** Ensure shared types are generated: `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <your-project-id> --schema public > supabase/functions/_shared/database.types.ts` (Replace `<your-project-id>`).
