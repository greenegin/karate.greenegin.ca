# Karate Class Website

## Project Overview

Develop a comprehensive and user-friendly karate class management website for 
Sensei Negin's classes (details managed in `app/config/site.ts`), 
incorporating efficient family-oriented registration, 
achievement tracking, attendance monitoring, payment integration, and waiver management.

## Website Functionality

### User-facing Features:

- Home Page:

    - Introduction to karate emphasizing personal growth and defense techniques.
    - Class schedule and location details (see `app/config/site.ts`).

- Instructor Profile:

  - Comprehensive bio for Sensei Negin detailing certifications and achievements.

- Registration and Family Management:

    - Family-centric registration allowing multiple children per family.
    - Secure login and family account management.
    - Detailed input fields for family information, guardian(s), and student details.

- Attendance and Achievement Tracking:

    - Automated attendance tracking system.
    - Real-time reporting to identify absentees.
    - Achievement logging for each student to track progress and milestones.

- Payment Integration:

  - Linking parent payments directly to individual children, accommodating multiple children per family.
  - Secure payment processing with transaction records for families.
  - Pricing Structure: Free Trial, $49/1st mo, $100/2nd mo, $121/monthly ongoing (details in `app/config/site.ts`).
  - **Dynamic Tier Calculation:** The payment tier for each student (1st Month, 2nd Month, Ongoing) is calculated dynamically on the payment page (`/family/payment`). It checks the count of past *successful* payments linked to the student via the `payments` and `payment_students` tables.
    - 0 past payments -> 1st Month price
    - 1 past payment -> 2nd Month price
    - 2+ past payments -> Ongoing Monthly price
    - This avoids storing a separate "tier" status in the database.
  - **Eligibility Check:** Student eligibility ("Trial", "Active", "Expired") is determined based on the date of their *most recent* successful payment (within the last ~35 days) or if they have zero payment history ("Trial"). This logic is in `app/utils/supabase.server.ts` and displayed in the Family Portal and Admin panels.

- Online Waivers and Policies:

    - Digitally accessible and signable waivers including:
      - Liability Release
      - Code of Conduct
      - Photo/Video consent
      - Payment and Dress Code agreement

### Administrative Features:
- Secure and intuitive admin interface for managing families, students, attendance, payments, and waivers.
- Detailed reporting tools for attendance, financials, and student achievements.
- Notification system for attendance irregularities.
